# TeachingUnitTests

Basic Android unit tests, not dynamic and only runs once for the time being before tests will fail because DB has been changed,
I might make it dynamic in the future but I wouldn't put money on it.

This was developed because I was asked to teach a class how to do Junits within android, not only was it boring to develop
it's also boring to look at.

I guess the moral of the story is not to agree to teach a class anything, I couldn't really be fussed doing it, but look
at me now, a fucking teacher. Buzzing.
